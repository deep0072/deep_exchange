# Trading Platform Architecture

This document describes the architecture of a trading platform, as illustrated in the provided diagram.

---

## Overview

The platform facilitates real-time trading, order processing, and price/ticker updates. It is designed for scalability, real-time responsiveness, and efficient data storage.

---

## Architecture Components

### 1. Browser (Client)
- **Role:** User-facing interface for trading.
- **Interactions:**
  - Sends user orders to the API server.
  - Receives real-time ticker/price updates via the WebSocket server.

### 2. API Server
- **Role:** Entry point for user actions.
- **Interactions:**
  - Receives user requests/orders from the browser.
  - Forwards orders to the processing queue.

### 3. Queue
- **Role:** Buffers and routes requests/events for asynchronous processing.
- **Interactions:**
  - Receives orders from the API server.
  - Passes orders to the Order Book (Trading Engine).

### 4. Order Book (Trading Engine)
- **Role:** Core matching and processing engine.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Maintains user balances and processes trades.
  - Publishes events (e.g., `user order filled`, price updates) to the pub/sub system.
  - Sends ticker price information to the pub/sub system.
  - Sends trade events (with price and quantity) to a secondary trade queue for further processing.

### 5. Pub/Sub System
- **Role:** Event distribution mechanism.
- **Interactions:**
  - Broadcasts order and ticker events to subscribers (e.g., WebSocket server, API server).

### 6. WebSocket Server
- **Role:** Real-time communication with clients.
- **Interactions:**
  - Subscribes to ticker updates via pub/sub.
  - Sends real-time updates to the browser.

### 7. Trade Queue
- **Role:** Queues trade events for persistence.
- **Interactions:**
  - Receives trade events (price, quantity) from the order book.
  - Forwards them to the DB processor.

### 8. DB Processor
- **Role:** Processes and stores trade events.
- **Interactions:**
  - Reads from the trade queue.
  - Formats and writes trade data (price, timestamp) to the database.

### 9. Time Scale DB
- **Role:** Time-series database for historical trade data.
- **Interactions:**
  - Stores processed trade data for analysis and reporting.

## Data Flow Summary

1. **Order Lifecycle:**
   `Browser → API Server → Queue → Order Book → (Pub/Sub for updates)`

2. **Market Data Updates:**
   `Order Book → Pub/Sub → WebSocket Server → Browser`

3. **Trade Settlement and Storage:**
   `Order Book → Trade Queue → DB Processor → Time Scale DB`

---

## Key Concepts

- **Asynchronous Processing:**
  Queues and pub/sub systems are used for scalability and non-blocking operations.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  WebSocket server ensures users receive live market data.

- **Event-Driven Architecture:**
  Pub/sub decouples components, allowing for scalable event handling.

- **Persistent Storage:**
  All trades are stored in a time-series database for historical analysis.
